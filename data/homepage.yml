  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
    full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
    good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
    leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
